In this project I used SQLite Studio RDBMS to load datafile, BIT_DB and wrote SQL queries to answer questions.

/*1.How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';*/

/*2.How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product="iPhone"
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; */

/*3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers Cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
ON Cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';*/

/*4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, Min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;*/

/*5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Totalrevenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;*/

/*6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Qualtity,SUM(Quantity*price) AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;*/

/*7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';*/

/*8.List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.*/
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

/*9.Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderID) FROM 
BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY  location 
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3;*/

/*10.How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity FROM 
BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%Headphones'
GROUP BY Product;*/

/*11.What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(acctnum) AS AVERAGE
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Cust 
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_ID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

/*12.what was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';*/

/*13.Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?*/
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity*price)
 FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 GROUP BY Product
 ORDER BY SUM (Quantity*price) DESC
 LIMIT 1;
